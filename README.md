collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all
 to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
Marionette JS
The Backbone Framework, Marionette simplifies your Backbone application code with robust views and architecture solutions
Marionette provides the structure required for those types of applications, and also provides guidance on how to structure 
larger JavaScript codebases.Marionette addresses the biggest problem with backbone, which is all the boilerplate in 
the view layer. It is also easy to make your own component hierarchies and provides minimal structure for everything you need.
